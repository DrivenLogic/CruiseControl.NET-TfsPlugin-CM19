A fork of CruiseControl.NET that adds the following features:

* A Transport extension for TFS 2010
* Support for the X10 CM19 USB firecracker 

The end result being that you can use one tool (cc tray) to monitor both Cruise and TFS builds.
CM19 support will allow the lava to flow for those of us with the newer USB Firecracker.
